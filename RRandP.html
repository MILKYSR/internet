        <h2>Routers:</h2>
        <p>A router is a device that manages internet traffic between your devices, such as your computer, phone, or tablet, and the internet. It works like a traffic controller, choosing the best route for data to move. When you connect to Wi-Fi, the router handles the sending and receiving of data, enabling you to visit websites, watch videos, or access online services.

        <h2>Redundancy:</h2>
      <img   
        <p>Redundancy refers to having extra systems or parts ready to keep things running smoothly if something fails. For example, if a server fails, another one turns on automatically. or if one internet connection goes down, a backup connection will start working. This setup helps avoid downtime and keeps services avaliable, even when there is problems

        <h2>Packets:</h2>
        <p>Data is sent across the internet in small units called packets. Packets are small pieces of data sent over the internet. When you send something, like an email or a request for a website, it splits into smaller packets to move through networks. Each packet holds an amount of the data and details about its source and destination. When all the packets arrive at their destination, they are put back together to recreate the original message or file. This method makes sending data faster and easier.</p>
